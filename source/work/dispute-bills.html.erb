    <h2>Branding</h2>
    <p>The Dispute Bills brand provides users that just received an expensive medical bill with a sense of reassurance, experience, and efficiency. The color palette we selected uses blue to give off a sense of trust, reliability, and calmness. Whereas the green implies success and savings—two things their users are hoping for when it comes to their case. We chose Noto Sans as the primary typeface, which looks professional yet friendly and approachable. The logo illustrates a stack of papers to represent “bills piling up,” the cross is signifies the medical industry, and the bills are angled to suggest movement giving users the feeling that their cases are handled with speed and efficiency.</p>

    <h2>UX Design</h2>
    <p>The user experience in the app had to accomplish
    I designed optimized views for both Users and Advocates when displaying "My Cases". Users would typically has less cases active at a time, giving me plently of space to work with. Since bills are time-sensitive, displaying the status would be most valuable for the user to know that their case is being worked on and what phase advocates are in the process (ulimately providing them with peace of mind). Advocates on the other hand would need a more tabular view to scan a longer list of cases quickly and see what their next to-do item is. Easy onboaring was important to get people quickly signed up and on there way to submitting their first dispute. They had already been using a form in the past to collect some of this information, so starting with that foundation I was able to strip it down to the essentials and add conditional states. Meaning depending on a person's response to a question, more fields may appear.
