    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prevent Blindness is a patient advocate for healthy vision. Their content-rich site provides a lot of resources and information on eye-related topics. Donations to their organization help support vision screenings for children, provide access to eye care for low income families, and fund research. They wanted a site that showcased their dedication and passion for promoting healthy vision for life.</p>

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>The goal was to celebrate vision, so to do that I added a nice balance of images and colors to every page. I created a secondary color palette that would compliment their existing brand as well as add some variety and excitement. The typography was inspired by classic vision charts, this slab-serif font serves as the header font on the site. The body font is a condensed sans-serif font with a slightly loosened kerning for optimal legibility.</p>
