    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>The split layout allowed us to strike an even balance between the copy and images. To really highlight the types of properties WHIREP manages, there is a slideshow that cycles through several large images of the buildings in their portfolio. The leadership page shows the professional and friendly faces of WHIREP's team. The boxed outline around the headers compliment the logo to tie the whole site together.</p>
